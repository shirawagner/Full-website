                            Rome and Venice in the 17th and 18th centuries to the French House of the Bourbons. From
                            here, the traditional revelry of "Boeuf Gras," or fatted calf, followed France to her
                            colonies.</h1>

                            <p>On March 2, 1699, French-Canadian explorer Jean Baptiste Le Moyne Sieur de Bienville
                                arrived at a plot of ground 60 miles directly south of New Orleans, and named it "Pointe
                                du Mardi Gras" when his men realized it was the eve of the festive holiday. Bienville
                                also established "Fort Louis de la Louisiane" (which is now Mobile) in 1702. In 1703,
                                the tiny settlement of Fort Louis de la Mobile celebrated America's very first Mardi
                                Gras.</p>
                            <p>
                                In 1704, Mobile established a secret society (Masque de la Mobile), similar to those
                                that form our current Mardi Gras krewes. It lasted until 1709. In 1710, the "Boeuf Gras
                                Society" was formed and paraded from 1711 through 1861. The procession was held with a
                                huge bull's head pushed along on wheels by 16 men. Later, Rex would parade with an
                                actual bull, draped in white and signaling the coming Lenten meat fast. This occurred on
                                Fat Tuesday.
                            </p>

                            <p>New Orleans was established in 1718 by Bienville. By the 1730s, Mardi Gras was celebrated
                                openly in New Orleans, but not with the parades we know today. In the early 1740s,
                                Louisiana's governor, the Marquis de Vaudreuil, established elegant society balls, which
                                became the model for the New Orleans Mardi Gras balls of today.</p>
                            <p>
                                The earliest reference to Mardi Gras "Carnival" appears in a 1781 report to the Spanish
                                colonial governing body. That year, the Perseverance Benevolent & Mutual Aid Association
                                was the first of hundreds of clubs and carnival organizations formed in New Orleans.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                By the late 1830s, New Orleans held street processions of maskers with carriages and
                                horseback riders to celebrate Mardi Gras. Dazzling gaslight torches, or "flambeaux," lit
                                the way for the krewe's members and lent each event an exciting air of romance and
                                festivity. In 1856, six young Mobile natives formed the Mistick Krewe of Comus, invoking
                                John Milton's hero Comus to represent their organization. Comus brought magic and
                                mystery to New Orleans with dazzling floats (known as tableaux cars) and masked balls.
                                Krewe members remained anonymous.

                        <p class="traditions-p">
                            Mardi Gras is about music, parades, picnics, floats and excitement. It's one big holiday in
                            New Orleans!

                            Revelers know to wear costumes or at least dress in purple, green, and gold, and adorn
                            themselves with long beads caught from the floats of previous parades. You'll see a lot of
                            crazy costumes, kids with their families are everywhere, and both locals and visitors having
                            a great time. Parade goers will sit on the ground, throw balls, play music, eat great food
                            and watch the crowds walk by between parades. On Mardi Gras day, the majority of
                            non-essential businesses are shut down because of the celebration.</p>

                            Every year, we get a lot of questions about how it all begin, and how the traditions have

                        <p>Mardi Gras is full of secrets, and the Mardi Gras Indians are as much a part of that secrecy
                            as any other carnival organization. Their parade dates, times and routes are never published
                            in advance, although they do tend to gather in the same areas every year.</p>
                        <p class="indians-p">
                            The Mardi Gras Indians are comprised, in large part, of the African-American communities of
                            New Orleans's inner city. While these Indians have paraded for well over a century, their
                            parade is perhaps the least recognized Mardi Gras tradition.

                            Traditional Mardi Gras organizations form a "krewe." A krewe often names their parade after
                            a particular Roman or Greek mythological hero or god. The ranking structure of a Mardi Gras
                            Krewe is a parody of royalty: King, Queen, Dukes, Knights and Captains, or some variation of
                            that theme. Many of the more established krewes allow membership by invitation only.

                            New Orleanians who do it right never have to worry about post Christmas letdown. That's
                            because the day that to most of the world is the twelfth and final day of Christmas is
                            recognized here as Twelfth Night, the first day of the Carnival season. Quite literally,
                            Carnival begins at the moment when Christmas ends. In other places, people have long ditched
                            their Christmas trees by January 6, but in New Orleans the trees stand, at least until that
                            date, when their sagging limbs and shedding needles seem unable to contain the old season
                            any longer.

                            In places where Carnival is not practiced, Twelfth Night is just another winter evening, but
                            in New Orleans, the night is alive with subtle native rituals that are still spared the
                            gaudiness and encroaching commercialism found as the season reaches its end on Mardi Gras.
                            For almost a century and a half, The Twelfth Night Revelers have held their society ball on
                            that evening, quietly and privately recognizing the season.

                        <h3>King Cakes</h3>
                        <p class="cakes-p">Mardi Gras and king cakes go hand in hand – especially in New Orleans where
                            hundreds of
                            thousands of king cakes are enjoyed at parties, offices and in homes every year.

                            According to the Christian faith, Jesus first showed himself to the three wise men and to
                            the world on January 6th, also known as Twelfth Night or the Epiphany. The word "Epiphany”
                            is from the Greek word "to show.” This is the day Mardi Gras season – hence king cake season
                            – begins.</p>

                        <p class="d-none d-md-block">
                            Each king cake has a tiny baby inside (generally plastic now, but it's possible the baby
                            might be made of porcelain or even gold). In the past, you might have found an item such as
                            a coin, bean, pecan or pea in a king cake. The lucky person who receives the slice of cake
                            with the baby has the next king cake party (or brings the next cake for the office).

                        <i>LaToya Cantrell (born April 3, 1972) is an American politician serving as the Mayor of New
                            Orleans, Louisiana, a post she has held since May 7, 2018. Cantrell, a Democrat, is the
                            first black woman to hold the post. Before becoming mayor, Cantrell represented District B
                            on the New Orleans City Council from 2012–2018</i>

                        </div>
                        <p>Cantrell was inaugurated as mayor on May 7, 2018, the first woman to hold the position in the
                            city's history.[28] Once in office, she established a new Office of Youth and Families, with
                            the goal of creating a strategic plan to address families in crisis in the city. Cantrell
                            also founded a Gun Violence Reduction Council tasked with finding solutions to violent
                            crime.[29] Starting with a push to rededicate hotel taxes collected within the city for city
                            use, Cantrell has focused on her #fairshare initiative to improve city infrastructure,
                            public transportation, public parks, and green spaces.[30] As part of that initiative, in
                            October 2018 the City of New Orleans filed a lawsuit against four opioid manufacturers and
                            distributors</p>
                        <p>During the 2019 session of the Louisiana Legislature, Cantrell negotiated the Fair Share
                            Agreement with Governor John Bel Edwards and city, state, and tourism officials. The
                            agreement secured $50 million in upfront funding for the city's infrastructure needs as well
                            as $26 million in annual recurring revenue for the city. Following the approval of the Fair
                            Share Agreement, New Orleans voters approved three of the four proposals Mayor Cantrell and
                            the City Council put on the ballot in the 2019 general election. Voters approved a $500
                            million bond sale and a tax on short-term rental properties, as well the establishment of a
                            Human Right Commission under the New Orleans Home Rule Charter.</p>
                        <h3>Awards</h3>
                        <p>In 2016, Cantrell was given a lifetime achievement award by the presidents of Tulane, Loyola
                            and Xavier universities and the University of New Orleans for her service to the community
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In 2012, Cantrell declared her candidacy for the New Orleans City Council seat vacated when
                            former District B representative Stacy Head won an election to an at-large position. After
                            the November election, candidate Dana Kaplan and Cantrell advanced to a December runoff,
                            which Cantrell won with 54 percent of the vote. Cantrell served out the balance of Head's
                            term, and was unopposed for a full four-year term in 2014. </p>
                            <p>
                                As a council member, Cantrell focused on health, housing, and criminal-justice issues. She
                                introduced a bill banning smoking at restaurants and bars within New Orleans, citing the health
                                effects of secondhand smoke on service industry workers. The council unanimously passed the bill
                                in 2015.
                            </p>

                       
                        <p>
                            Also in 2015, Cantrell began work to open a low-barrier homeless shelter, a move that was
                            objected to by residents because of its proposed placement in Central City, New Orleans.
                            Instead, the shelter was moved to the downtown site of the former VA Hospital. In 2017,
                            Cantrell introduced legislation with at-large council member Jason Williams to register and
                            inspect rental units in the city.

                            As a member of the Criminal Justice Committee, Cantrell has participated in efforts to
                            install crime cameras in her district, assess the effectiveness of citywide
                            anti-gun-violence campaigns, and address understaffing at the New Orleans Police Department.
